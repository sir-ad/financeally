"Review : Unlike what you learn in school (mainly theories), this gives you real-world skills you can use as tools to succeed in business or career alike. The instructor is very straight to the point and focus but has a way of teaching that makes it engaging. There’s a lot of material for all levels of Excel​ users. It’s exactly what I expected. It’s Perfect. -Jordan Scuffle"
