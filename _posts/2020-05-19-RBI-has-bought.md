We have complained that the RBI isn’t doing that much to help in #Covid19, while the west is going bonkers. But now we stand corrected – in what seems to be a  **big bazooka underappreciated mechanism, the RBI has just done a quantitative easing of serious size**.

In the last two months, since 19 March when the Coronavirus impact really hit us, the  **Reserve Bank has bought over Rs. 160,000 cr. of Indian government bonds**  on it’s balance sheet.
