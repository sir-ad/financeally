We have complained that the RBI isn’t doing that much to help in #Covid19, while the west is going bonkers. But now we stand corrected – in what seems to be a  **big bazooka underappreciated mechanism, the RBI has just done a quantitative easing of serious size**.

In the last two months, since 19 March when the Coronavirus impact really hit us, the  **Reserve Bank has bought over Rs. 160,000 cr. of Indian government bonds**  on it’s balance sheet.

Through the Covid19 Crisis, the RBI has been buying government bonds, keeping them from sliding.

This may not sound big to you, but it effectively does two things:

-   **reduces the interest rates**  that the government has to pay, and then, in the whole system
-   keeps the system  **flush with liquidity**, which is important in a crisis.
